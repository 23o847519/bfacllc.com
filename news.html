<pre class="termNews"><h1>Show Time! 23/9/2022</h1>
Hello there! For just about all of you this should be your first time seeing our little website. We hope you find it as SOVLful as we do. 
We ran into a few hiccups getting things together so the website/shop split is our stop gap while we work on something even nicer.

Now I know why some of you are here and that's because some people missed out or want to buy even more Yoruba coins. 
Sit tight for a little bit longer, by the time you see this it should be a few hours before we make the Yotsuba's active on the store (12AM EST).
Feel free to look around between now and then, and I mean really take a look. We have some fun surprises hidden around for the more inquisitive users out there.
If you do happen to notice anything a bit broken, email us and we will see to it that's its fixed. </pre>

Well...One of you nosey little rascals found the site!
We were <i>planning</i> on keeping this a little bit under wraps until the release of Megumin Coin but if you're reading this, that clearly didn't happen!

The site is still being worked on a bit (because we didn't expect you to be here!) so be please patiant with us.
<b>ALSO</b> UNTIL YOU DO NOT SEE THIS TEXT, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, <strong>DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ON THIS SITE!!</strong> YOUR MONEY WILL BE SENT INTO THE <i>V  O  I  D!!</i></pre>
